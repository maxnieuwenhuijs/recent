Frontend and Backend made with Javascrip (ReactJS and NodeJS). I operated on my own, and I wrote every line of the source files.

Uploaded parts of the source files to indicate my understanding of JS. 

Both the dating / elearning portals are designed in a way to support multiple domains pointing to the server, so the same content can quickly be rebranded.

I'm aware it is sometimes not the perfect solution for some challenges,
but my last employer wanted things to deploy rather quick and dirty than correct and well thought out.

I'm now learning and following courses on C# and Typescript to further develop my programming skills. (C# because I want to make a mobile game and Typescript because that is required in bigger companies to structure the JS code)
